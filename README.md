This is a small Python Script that will iterate through a user's downloaded Google Search Archive JSON files(https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6068625?hl=en) and output just the search text, instead of all of the other generally useless information.

The JSON that they give you in the downloadable archive is not formatted in an easy to read way, so this script was created to solve that problem.
