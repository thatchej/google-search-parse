This is a small Python Script that will iterate through a user's downloaded Google Search Archive (https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6068625?hl=en)

The JSON that they give you in the downloadable archive is not formatted in an easy to read way, so this script will take just the search text and output it to a text file called searches.txt.
